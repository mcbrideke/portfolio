            Enthuse was a social media application that
            I worked on with a group for our senior project.
            Our motivation for making Enthuse was to build an app
            for community based hobbies and interests
            that would have multi-level filters for both the
            category of the community and the geograpical closeness
            of the group, so that we could provide a place for both
			general discussions and local  meetups.<br />

            University Chat was my first venture into mobile
            development as I worked with a group to make a
            chat application for college students. Our idea
            for University Chat was to have students verify their
            id then be automatically added to a chat for each of
            their courses. Some features we implemented were: direct messages,
			account management, pinned announcements, and file upload.<br />
